        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Karthik Saggidi, a passionate frontend web developer with a strong interest in designing and building interactive, user-friendly websites. My focus is on creating clean, modern, and visually appealing web experiences that enhance usability and engagement. I love working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frontend frameworks to bring creative ideas to life.

            From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how websites function and how design influences user behavior. Over time, I developed a deep interest in UI/UX design, ensuring that every project I work on is both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional. I enjoy experimenting with different styles, layouts, and animations to enhance the user experience.
            
            Although I have experience with backend development, my passion lies in the frontend. I prefer focusing on the visual and interactive aspects of web applications rather than dealing with databases and server-side logic. My goal is to build responsive, intuitive, and accessible websites that provide users with a seamless experience across all devices.
            
            I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest web technologies and design trends. Whether it’s improving performance, optimizing layouts, or integrating smooth animations, I always strive to enhance the quality of my work.
            
            I am always open to new challenges, collaborations, and opportunities that push my creative and technical skills further. If you’re looking for someone who is passionate about building engaging digital experiences, let’s connect and create something amazing together! </p>
